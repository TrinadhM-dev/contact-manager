They are multiple clients we will use for httpRequests

1) ThunderClient
In Controller contains all logic for req response and connect with database 
req.body even though we send the request it shows undefined.
whenever we are fetching or accepting the data from client to server we need to send some bodyParser through middleware.

while we write error keyword for condition it creates error that gives you html data kind of error but not json so we have to create some customized middleware.


mongoose which is object model design schema
 entities like contact/schema which helps us to communicate with mongo db 


JSON Web Token
 1.Header Algorithm Token

whenever client is sending email and password ..We need to match user email and password
